## Q: Identifying AI Services for Document Processing

> Which service should you use to extract key information such as dates, amounts, and vendor names from scanned invoices?

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Text Analytics `This is incorrect because Text Analytics is used for analyzing unstructured text data, such as sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction.`
- [ ] B. Language Understanding `This is incorrect because Language Understanding (LUIS) is used for building natural language understanding models, not for extracting structured data from scanned documents.`
- [ ] C. Custom Vision `This is incorrect because Custom Vision is used for image classification and object detection, not for extracting structured data from scanned documents.`
- [x] D. Form Recognizer `This is the correct answer because Form Recognizer is designed to extract key information such as dates, amounts, and vendor names from scanned documents like invoices.`

## Q: Extracting Data from Business Cards

> Which service should you use to automatically extract contact information such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses from scanned business cards?

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Text Analytics `This is incorrect because Text Analytics is used for analyzing unstructured text data, such as sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction.`
- [ ] B. Language Understanding `This is incorrect because Language Understanding (LUIS) is used for building natural language understanding models, not for extracting structured data from scanned documents.`
- [ ] C. Custom Vision `This is incorrect because Custom Vision is used for image classification and object detection, not for extracting structured data from scanned documents.`
- [x] D. Form Recognizer `This is the correct answer because Form Recognizer is designed to extract contact information such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses from scanned documents like business cards.`

## Q: Extracting Data from Medical Forms

> Which service should you use to extract patient information such as names, dates of birth, and medical history from scanned medical forms?

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Text Analytics `This is incorrect because Text Analytics is used for analyzing unstructured text data, such as sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction.`
- [ ] B. Language Understanding `This is incorrect because Language Understanding (LUIS) is used for building natural language understanding models, not for extracting structured data from scanned documents.`
- [ ] C. Custom Vision `This is incorrect because Custom Vision is used for image classification and object detection, not for extracting structured data from scanned documents.`
- [x] D. Form Recognizer `This is the correct answer because Form Recognizer is designed to extract patient information such as names, dates of birth, and medical history from scanned documents like medical forms.`


## Q: Extracting Information from Scanned Documents

> Which service should you use to analyze and extract structured data, such as text, key/value pairs, and tables, from scanned receipts?

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Text Analytics `This is incorrect because Text Analytics is used for analyzing unstructured text data, such as sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction.`
- [ ] B. Language Understanding `This is incorrect because Language Understanding (LUIS) is used for building natural language understanding models, not for extracting structured data from scanned documents.`
- [ ] C. Custom Vision `This is incorrect because Custom Vision is used for image classification and object detection, not for extracting structured data from scanned documents.`
- [x] D. Form Recognizer `This is the correct answer because Form Recognizer is designed to extract text, key/value pairs, and table data from scanned documents, such as receipts and invoices.`


## Q: Analyzing Images for Specific Criteria

> You are organizing a photo contest where participants submit images of landscapes. The task is to ensure that only photos with at least one tree and a visible horizon are accepted. Which operation should you use to analyze the images?

**Options:**
- [ ] A. The Verify operation in the Face service `This is incorrect because the Verify operation is used to compare faces, not analyze landscape images.`
- [ ] B. The Detect operation in the Face service `This is incorrect because the Detect operation is used to identify faces in images, not landscape features.`
- [ ] C. The Analyze Image operation in the Computer Vision service `This is incorrect because while the Analyze Image operation provides information about the image, it is not as specific as the Describe Image operation for identifying detailed features like trees and horizons.`
- [X] D. The Describe Image operation in the Computer Vision service `This is the correct answer because the Describe Image operation provides a detailed description of the image content, including objects like trees and horizons.`

## Q: Identifying Computer Vision Tasks

> Identifying and labeling each pixel in an image to determine whether it belongs to a car, road, or pedestrian is an example of:

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Image classification `This is incorrect because image classification involves categorizing the entire image into a single category, not labeling individual pixels.`
- [ ] B. Object detection `This is incorrect because object detection involves identifying and locating objects within an image, often using bounding boxes, not labeling individual pixels.`
- [ ] C. Optical character recognition (OCR) `This is incorrect because OCR involves recognizing and extracting text from images, not labeling individual pixels.`
- [x] D. Semantic segmentation `This is the correct answer because semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in an image into a category, such as car, road, or pedestrian.`
