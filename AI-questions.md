## Q: Identifying the business benefit

> A company hires customer service agents to handle phone and email support. They create a webchat bot to answer common questions automatically. What benefits should they expect from this webchat bot?

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Increased customer complaints: `This is unlikely because a well-implemented webchat bot should improve customer service by providing quick responses to common queries.`
- [ ] B. Increased workload for the customer service agents. `This is incorrect because the purpose of the webchat bot is to reduce the workload by handling routine queries.`
- [ ] C. Decreased efficiency in handling customer queries. `This is incorrect because the webchat bot is designed to increase efficiency by providing instant responses to common queries.`
- [X] D. A reduced workload for the customer service agents `This is the correct answer. The webchat bot automates responses to common questions, allowing human agents to focus on more complex issues, thus reducing their overall workload.`
