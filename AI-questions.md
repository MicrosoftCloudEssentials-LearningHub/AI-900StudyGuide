## Q: Identifying AI Techniques for Entity Extraction

> Which AI technique is used to identify and classify specific entities such as names, dates, and locations within text?

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Key phrase extraction `This is incorrect because key phrase extraction identifies important phrases in text, not specific entities like names, dates, and locations.`
- [ ] B. Language detection `This is incorrect because language detection identifies the language of the text, not specific entities.`
- [ ] C. Sentiment Analysis `This is incorrect because sentiment analysis determines the sentiment or emotion expressed in the text.`
- [x] D. Named Entity Recognition (NER) `This is the correct answer because Named Entity Recognition (NER) is used to identify and classify specific entities such as names, dates, and locations within text.`


## Q: Matching AI Workloads with Descriptions

> Match each AI workload type with its corresponding description.

**Workload Types:**
1. Anomaly detection
2. Computer vision
3. Machine Learning (Classification)
4. Natural language processing

**Descriptions:**
- [ ] A. Detecting spam emails based on their content.
- [ ] B. Recognizing faces in a photo.
- [ ] C. Identifying unusual patterns in network traffic to detect cyber attacks.
- [ ] D. Classifying emails as spam or not spam.

**Answers:**
- [`Anomaly detection`] C. Identifying unusual patterns in network traffic to detect cyber attacks. `This is the correct answer because anomaly detection involves finding deviations from normal patterns, such as in cybersecurity.`
- [`Computer vision`] B. Recognizing faces in a photo. `This is the correct answer because computer vision is about interpreting visual data from the world.`
- [`Machine Learning (Classification)`] D. Classifying emails as spam or not spam. `This is the correct answer because classification involves categorizing data into predefined classes.`
- [`Natural language processing`] A. Detecting spam emails based on their content. `This is the correct answer because natural language processing involves understanding and interpreting human language.`

## Q: Ensuring Transparency in AI Systems

> You are building an AI system. Which task should you include to ensure that the service meets the Microsoft transparency principle for responsible AI?

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Ensure that the AI system's decision-making process is documented and accessible to users. `This is the correct answer because transparency involves making the AI system's workings understandable to users.`
- [ ] B. Enable autoscaling to ensure that a service scales based on demand. `This is incorrect because autoscaling is related to performance and scalability, not transparency.`
- [ ] C. Ensure that the AI system is tested for biases and fairness. `This is incorrect because testing for biases and fairness relates to the fairness principle, not transparency.`
- [ ] D. Provide training for users on how to interact with the AI system. `This is incorrect because providing user training is related to usability, not transparency.`

**Answers:**
- [`Transparency`] A. Ensure that the AI system's decision-making process is documented and accessible to users. `This is the correct answer because transparency involves making the AI system's workings understandable to users.`
- [`Performance and Scalability`] B. Enable autoscaling to ensure that a service scales based on demand. `This is incorrect because autoscaling is related to performance and scalability, not transparency.`
- [`Fairness`] C. Ensure that the AI system is tested for biases and fairness. `This is incorrect because testing for biases and fairness relates to the fairness principle, not transparency.`
- [`Usability`] D. Provide training for users on how to interact with the AI system. `This is incorrect because providing user training is related to usability, not transparency.`


## Q: Ensuring Consistent Operation in AI Systems

> When developing an AI system for medical diagnosis, the Microsoft __________ principle for responsible AI should be applied to ensure the system operates reliably and safely under various conditions.

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Inclusiveness `This is incorrect because inclusiveness focuses on making AI accessible to all, including people with disabilities.`
- [ ] B. Accountability `This is incorrect because accountability involves ensuring that humans can override AI decisions and take responsibility for outcomes.`
- [ ] C. Fairness `This is incorrect because fairness focuses on treating all people equally and avoiding biases.`
- [x] D. Reliability and Safety `This is the correct answer because reliability and safety ensure that AI systems operate as intended and can handle unexpected conditions without causing harm.`


## Q: Matching Microsoft AI Principles with Descriptions

> Match each Microsoft AI principle with its corresponding description.

**Principles:**
1. Fairness
2. Inclusiveness
3. Privacy and Security
4. Reliability and Safety
5. Transparency

**Descriptions:**
- [ ] A. Ensuring that AI systems are understandable and their decisions can be explained.
- [ ] B. Making sure AI systems treat all people equally and avoid biases.
- [ ] C. Providing users with control over their data and ensuring it is protected.
- [ ] D. Designing AI systems to work as intended and resist harmful manipulation.
- [x] E. Empowering everyone, including people with disabilities, to use AI systems.

**Answers:**
- [`Fairness`] B. Making sure AI systems treat all people equally and avoid biases. `This is the correct answer because fairness involves ensuring that AI systems do not discriminate against any group.`
- [`Inclusiveness`] E. Empowering everyone, including people with disabilities, to use AI systems. `This is the correct answer because inclusiveness focuses on making AI accessible to all.`
- [`Privacy and Security`] C. Providing users with control over their data and ensuring it is protected. `This is the correct answer because privacy and security involve safeguarding user information.`
- [`Reliability and Safety`] D. Designing AI systems to work as intended and resist harmful manipulation. `This is the correct answer because reliability and safety ensure that AI systems are dependable and secure.`
- [`Transparency`] A. Ensuring that AI systems are understandable and their decisions can be explained. `This is the correct answer because transparency involves making AI systems and their decisions clear to users.`

## Q: Identifying Microsoft AI Principles

> You are designing an AI system that ensures data privacy and protects user information. This is an example of which Microsoft guiding principle for responsible AI?

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Fairness `This is incorrect because fairness focuses on treating all people equally and avoiding biases.`
- [ ] B. Inclusiveness `This is incorrect because inclusiveness is about empowering everyone, including people with disabilities.`
- [ ] C. Reliability and Safety `This is incorrect because reliability and safety focus on ensuring that AI systems work as intended and minimize risks.`
- [x] D. Privacy and Security `This is the correct answer because privacy and security involve protecting user data and ensuring that information is kept confidential.`

## Q: Matching AI Workloads with Descriptions
